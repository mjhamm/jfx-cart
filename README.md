# jfx-cart
JavaFX application that replicates a shopping cart that buys items based on priority and budget

The application allows a customer to enter a budget, add and remove items from their cart, and finally go shopping to let the application add items (based on priority set by the customer, and as long as there is money in the budget) to a purchased and not purchased list.

Can be added to a SQL Database in the future to handle autocompletion of item entries. Information stored in the database can then be read out to the application to let the customer know what they bought and didn't buy last shopping trip.
